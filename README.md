## Installation

Install the SDK via Composer:

```bash
composer require upsun/upsun-sdk-php
```

Then include Composer's autoloader in your PHP application:

```php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
```

## Authentication

You will need an [Upsun API token](https://docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/api-tokens.html) to use this SDK.
Store it securely, preferably in an environment variable.

```php
use Upsun\UpsunConfig;
use Upsun\UpsunClient;

$config = new UpsunConfig(apiToken: getenv('UPSUN_API_TOKEN'));
$client = new UpsunClient($config);
```

## Usage

### Example: List organizations

```php
$organizations = $client->organizations->list();
```

### Example: List projects in an organization

```php
$projects = $client->organizations->listProjects('<organizationId>');
```

### Example: Get a project

```php
$project = $client->projects->get('<projectId>');
```

### Example: Create a project in a specific organization
```php
$project = $client->projects->create(
    '<organizationId>',
    'eu-5.platform.sh',
    'Project title',
    'main',
);
```

### Example: Update a project

```php
$response = $client->projects->update(
    projectId: '<projectId>',
    title: 'new Title',
    description: 'Description'
);
```

### Example: Delete a project

```php
$client->projects->delete('<projectId>');
```

## Development

composer install
```

## Architecture of this SDK

The SDK is built as follows:

* From the [JSON specs of our API](https://proxy.upsun.com/docs/openapispec-platformsh.json)
* Using [``@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli``](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40openapitools/openapi-generator-cli)
* Which generates:
  * PHP **Models** (in `src/Model/`)
  * PHP **APIs** (in `src/Api/`)
* Higher-level PHP (Facade) oriented **Tasks** (in `src/Core/Tasks/`)

### Regenerating API & Model classes

API and Model classes are generated using [openapi-generator-cli](https://openapi-generator.tech)
from the [Upsun OpenAPI spec](https://proxy.upsun.com/docs/openapispec-platformsh.json).

```bash
composer run spec:install
composer run spec:full
```
